  configuration of selective content synchronization from RHEL repos to other products, including
  but not limited to UBI DOT repos.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added

- `rhui_product_ids` - supersedes the now-deprecated `rhui_product_id`,
  allowing the definition of multiple RHUI product IDs.

content set.

## [3.0.0] - 2023-08-30

### Added

CDN repos and feature flags which should be enabled on those repos.

## [2.3.0] - 2021-11-09

### Added

- `releasever_alias` - Maps a major RHEL release version path prefix to the corresponding minor

   minor releases.

### Changed

- The concept of the project has changed significantly. The `cdn-definitions` project

  separately maintained (e.g. private) data set.
