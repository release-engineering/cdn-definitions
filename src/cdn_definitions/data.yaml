# Aliases between paths used for consuming content under RHUI entitlements.
#
# Each item defines a "src" (a path accessible under RHUI entitlements)
# and a "dest" (a path where identical content is accessible under non-RHUI entitlements).
# For example, /content/dist/rhel/rhui/X should be an alias for /content/dist/rhel/X.
#
# For some of these aliases, certain content is filtered under the /rhui/ paths
# (mainly architectures). This is currently not expressed in the dataset here.

# Aliases between paths relating to the origin area of CDN.
origin_alias:

# Top-level of origin is accessible also under "content".
#
# Original rationale: relative symlinks from Packages to origin were shared between rhui
# and non-rhui repos, but paths for rhui repos are one level deeper than non-rhui repos.
#
# That means a relative link starting with a sequence of "../../.." reaching up to
# /origin for a non-rhui repo would only reach up to /content/origin for a rhui repo;
# hence for the same link to work in both cases, this alias must exist.
- src: /content/origin
  dest: /origin

# "rpm" and "rpms" mean the same thing under origin.
#
# This was originally introduced due to a bug in publishing tools, where some code
# was designed for "rpms" while other code was designed for "rpm". Rather than fixing
# it properly, it was worked around by a symlink, and the workaround is now effectively
# permanent.
- src: /origin/rpm
  dest: /origin/rpms
