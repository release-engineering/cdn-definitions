# Aliases between paths used for consuming content under RHUI entitlements.
#
# Each item defines a "src" (a path accessible under RHUI entitlements)
# and a "dest" (a path where identical content is accessible under non-RHUI entitlements).
# For example, /content/dist/rhel/rhui/X should be an alias for /content/dist/rhel/X.
#
# For some of these aliases, certain content is filtered under the /rhui/ paths
# (mainly architectures). This is currently not expressed in the dataset here.
